svgbatch
========

The latest version of this documentation is online at:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/svgbatch

SvgBatch is a Python package to load SVG[1] vector graphic files, and convert
them into pyglet[2] Batch objects[3], for OpenGL rendering.

The polygons from the SVG file are tessellated using GLU functions[4], and used
to create a pyglet Batch object of indexed vertex arrays of GL_TRIANGLES. The
Batch will aggregate all paths from an SVG file into a single OpenGL primitive
for rendering. Each path is also exposed in its untessellated form, so the
application could use them for things other than rendering, for example
collision detection.

Currently only a subset of SVG is handled - paths forming closed polygons,
filled with solid color. Each path may comprise multiple loops (disjoint areas
or holes), but must be made up from straight line edges. Arcs, beziers,
gradient fills and other SVG entities such as rectangles or text are not
currently handled.


Status
------

Nominally complete, and works with some simple SVG files that were generated by
Inkscape[5], but has not yet been used in earnest.

Download
--------

You can install svgbatch to your site-packages directory, making it available
for import by all Python programs on your computer. The automated way to do
this is to install setuptools, then use the command-line:

    easy_install svgbatch

The manual way to do the same thing is to download the source distribution
from the bottom of the project PyPI page:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/svgbatch

and install manually, using the command-line:

    python setup.py install

Alternatively, the svgbatch package from the above source distribution can
be copied directly into your own project, which might be useful if you intend
to modify it.

Finally, to get the very latest (possibly broken) version, you might want to
check it out from Subversion on Google Code:

Usage
-----

Very straightforward::

    svg = SvgBatch('data/logo.svg')
    batch = svg.create_batch()

`create_batch()` returns a pyglet Batch object, which can be rendered in
a pyglet program using `batch.draw()`. See `svgbatch/demo.py`:

    http://code.google.com/p/svgload/source/browse/trunk/svgbatch/demo.py

Your application can access the untessellated geometry of each path, indexed
by id, using::

    path = svg.path_by_id['pathid']

where `pathid` is the string ID of the path tag in the SVG file. A path's ID
can be set from within Inkscape by editing its object properties. The returned
Path object has the following attributes:

  * id: string, copied from the svg tag's id attribute
  * color: triple of unsigned bytes, (r, g, b)
  * loops: a list of loops. A loop is a list of vertices. A vertex is a pair of
    floats or ints.
  * bounds: an object which provides the axis-aligned extents of the path, as
    xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax.
  * offset(x, y): a method which will add the given offset to all vertices in
    the path


Known Issues
------------

  * It generally chokes on real-world SVG files other than the small ones I'm
    saving from Inkscape, due to unhandled SVG entities such as rectangles or
    text. Avoid this by just using closed, straight-edged paths filled with
    plain color.
  * I've only tested it on Windows. My lappy graphics chipset doesn't work for
    OpenGL stuff on Ubuntu since Jaunty. Thanks ATI.

Many thanks to Martin O'Leary of supereffective.org, whos Squirtle module[6]
formed a major inspiration for this project, and in particular for his
sublime tesselation code, which I have copied wholesale under the terms of the
BSD.
