Description
-----------

A Python package to load SVG vector graphic files, and convert
them into pyglet Batch objects of indexed vertex arrays. These can then
be rendered by pyglet using OpenGL.

This has been tested with 2D objects read from SVG files saved by Inkscape.


Status
------

Still under development. Progressing nicely and gives some useful results,
but probably not ready for use by anyone but the author. See the project
TODO file for mode detail.


Thanks

Many thanks to Martin O'Leary of supereffective.org, whos Squirtle module
formed a major inspiration for this entire project, and in particular for
his sublime tesselation code. This has been copied wholesale, under the terms
